# 4-bit ALU using Verilog HDL

## Overview
This project implements a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL.
The ALU performs both arithmetic and logical operations based on a 3-bit select line.

## Operations Supported
- Addition
- Subtraction
- AND
- OR
- XOR
- NOT

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- Icarus Verilog
- GTKWave

## Simulation
The design is verified using a testbench and waveform analysis in GTKWave.
